There’s few emotions comparable to the disappointment of finally getting your braces removed amidst Covid-19's embrace of planet Earth. The smile you waited over a year for; the straightened gleaming white teeth that you wanted to show off in every social situation now finds itself shadowed underneath a piece of fabric. After spending a non-insignificant amount of currency on my health (God bless America!), and spending hours muting out the sounds of the infomercials playing in the dentist's waiting area, I can't even smile [publicly]? Disheartening.
</p>

<p>
But why be so dramatic over something that's mostly insignificant in the grand scheme of things? The pandemic will pass, and as long as I brush my teeth every night, I can just be patient and shine sunlight off my incisors into people's eyes right after, right?
</p>


<p>
Here's the facts: A smile is a gesture that, depending on how its manifested, can communicate a message more complex than entire languages can. Whether you're talking English, Mandarin, or C++, you could learn more from a smile, than you could in a thousand-word long paper in any of those languages. Smiles were basically the original language, much like the sign languages of today, but with only one sign.
</p>

<p>
They're a simple pleasure in life that many can find themselves devoid of. The absence of smiles in our lives can lead to some gnarly shit. Take it from Mr. Crooked Teeth here. I'm talking about both, seeing the smiles of others around you, and the smiles you produce yourself (barring the ones you awkwardly force out so you can get that family picture over with). It’s almost an evolutionary need at this point, to smile and to know that those around you are also smiling.

<p>
These days, in a country that’s made wedding arrangements with a virus, in a state where the asphalt can make a meaner omelette than your frying pan, and in a city rocked by social unrest, smiles can be a rare thing to come by. This couldn't have been more apparent than two days ago when I visited America's favorite funhouse, the DMV. With a line wrapping around the building two times over in the afternoon heat, and security guards engaged with keeping hecklers in check, I went in there with the bitchiest resting-bitch-face in history hidden underneath my mask. I mean, why would I or anyone in their right mind smile in such a place?
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to me getting in and being sent to another outdoor waiting area; an unconventionally young security guard makes eye contact with me several times as I got into line and aligned myself with the social distancing marker on the floor. Now I'm no stranger to law enforcement and their offshoots making uncomfortable amounts of eye contact with me. It's all in the day's work of being a chocolate-colored male. But this time it was completely different. This one felt like a complete reversal where I was somehow unintentionally filling this security guard with fear. When I say fear, I mean deer in headlights just doesn't cut it. His eyes were trying their damndest to stare into my essence, like I was some otherworldly being or something. I mean sure, the government here does refer to me as an alien, but this was too much.
</p>

<p>
I almost wanted to say something to the poor guy, that he's got it all wrong. I'm the one who's supposed to be fearful of law enforcement in this country. And at the federal government's most popular outpost at that. But me, pushing my melanin-production into overdrive, withstanding the LA afternoon sun for over an hour, couldn't muster up enough shits to give about the internal dilemma boiling up inside the guard's head. I just wanted to renew my driver's license damn it. I returned a glare back at him that might have come off as abrasive, although internally I was entirely confused by the situation.
</p>

<p>
Abruptly breaking eyesight with me, the guard finally moves and takes a step towards his left where a girl was sitting on the floor in a shaded area, similarly waiting for her license renewal. With him now towering above her as she looks down at her phone, this is the scene that then ensues before me less than six feet away:
</p>

<p>
<b>Guard</b>: *<i>in a nervous, timid voice</i>* Hi, uhm... what are you here for?
</p>

<p>
<b>Girl</b>: *<i>looks up at Guard</i>* I'm renewing my license. *<i>looks back down at phone</i>*
</p>

<p>
<b>Guard</b>: Got it. It's hot out here isn't it?
</p>

<p>
<b>Girl</b>: Yea
</p>

<p>
<b>Guard</b>: What's your name?
</p>

<p>
<b>Girl</b>: *<i>says her name</i>*
</p>

<p>
<b>Guard</b>: So... how old are you?
</p>

<p>
<b>Girl</b>: *<i>looks up</i>* Twenty *<i>promptly looks back down</i>*
</p>

<p>
<b>Guard</b>: *<i>makes fear-induced eye contact with me again, then looks back at the girl</i>* Cool… by the way, I like you…
</p>

<p>
<b>Girl</b>: *<i>looks up at Guard, nods an \"okay\", and returns to phone</i>* 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guard</b>: So… what's your number?
</p>

<p>
<b>Girl</b>: K-26
</p>

<p>
My number was K-29 for anyone wondering. The girl was three positions ahead of me in the queue. The guard, thrown off by her answer, tried to salvage the situation by asking specifically for her phone number and telling her that he'd \"follow her\". I know you can follow someone on Instagram, but following them after getting a phone number is a new one to me. He distanced himself from the girl at this point and, from what it seemed like, distanced himself from everyone else in the line who just witnessed that mess. None of this is being said to demean the poor guy by the way. I actually have mad respect for another dude just trying to up his game. But damn guy, you're working security. Your peers are droppin' bows with troublemakers on the other side of the building. And the girl you're trying to pick up is only there to pick up a rectangular piece of plastic that lets her operate her Prius. You gotta read the mood man.
</p>

<p>
But it was after witnessing this massacre that I realized that back when the guard was staring into my soul, he wasn't fearing me, but maybe looking to me for an ounce of comfort, before he put himself in that nerve-wrecking situation. I kind of get that. As a dude in their twenties, you would look for another person in your demographic for comfort for that sort of situation. Unfortunately for him, I could only see his eyes and he could only see mine. With the bottom two-thirds of our faces both obscured by a mask. Not only was I unable to discern his wide-eyed look of fear, he probably just got more nervous looking at my sweat traverse down my forehead lines. Had his entire expression been visible, perhaps I could have returned a smile of encouragement, if it weren't obstructed as well.
</p>

<p>
I'll be real though; I probably wasn't going to encourage that cringe-fest even if I didn't have a mask on. I thought about all this after my number had been called and I waited for the lady at the counter to process my documents. It was there that I understood that I didn't need my smile to tell him \"hey, believe in yourself and do your thing\". My eyes would have sufficed had I realized this form of communication earlier. I placed so much value on my freshly aligned teeth and other people's smiles, and the fact that they all were hidden by surgical masks, that I forgot about the language of the eyes. A language that predates humanity. The lady then had me do a vision test to see if my eyes were at least capable of that.
</p>

<p>
When time came to have my picture taken for my license, I thought I'd be going into it the same way I did three years ago. Just a forced smile that I'll look back on each time I open my wallet. As I got in the line for the picture, the same girl from earlier joined in behind me. In the wait, we exchanged thoughts about having our pictures taken, laughed at each other's old license pictures and even acknowledged the awkwardness of the situation with the guard. Neither of our smiles were visible to one another, yet we shared a genuine moment of high spirits without them. Although we exchanged words, this was an interaction guided by our eyes first and foremost. Had I not communicated good-will with my eyes, no verbiage would have salvaged the interchange.
</p>

<p>
My turn came to take the picture. The lady behind the counter asked me look at a specific marker, take off my mask and smile. Her directive to smile was redundant however, because unlike almost every other time I've had my picture taken, I couldn't rid myself of the smile I had even if I tried. And while the DMV's outdated camera is probably STILL going to produce the most abhorrent picture of me that’s possible, I'll always know that the smile in it is a sincere one.
</p>

<p>
So there it is. In a quarantine that won't let me smile, I managed to get my real smile, aided by the advent of modern orthodontics, immortalized on a plastic card that'll expire in a couple of years. More than that still, I discovered that even in times like these, your eyes alone can be your smile.
